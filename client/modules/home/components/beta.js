        It only serves for demonstration & testing purposes.
        Because of that, there is no public registration, yet. If you want to try the app out,
        you can <a href="mailto:shoetten[Ã¤t]uos[dot]de" title="Email">drop me a line</a> or
        ask an already registered friend to send you an invite link.
